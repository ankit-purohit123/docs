Tile.dev helps you build apps faster with AI, but like any creative tool, things can go off track. Maybe your app doesn't behave as expected, or a feature breaks. This guide will walk you through how to fix common issues and get back to building.

## Step 1: Use the **Attempt Fix** Button First

Tile automatically detects if the agent made an error while generating the app and shows the **"Attempt Fix"** button. All you need to do is to click on the 'Attempt Fix' button and send the message to the agent. This is the quickest & easiest way to resolve bugs in your app.

**What It Does:**
* Automatically captures the on-screen error message
* Inserts the error into the prompt box
* Prepares a ready-to-send prompt to help the agent **understand and fix the issue**

Just review the generated prompt and hit **Send**. The AI will try to debug and regenerate your app accordingly.

If "Attempt Fix" doesn't work after 1â€“2 attempts, stop there and move to Step 2

## Step 2: Investigate Bugs and Edit Code

You should edit the code in these situations:
1. The **"Attempt Fix"** button doesn't resolve the issue.
2. Your app runs, but something still feels off or isn't working as expected.

When you encounter these scenarios, take the following steps:
* **Review your prompt** to ensure it's clear and not overloaded with instructions.
* **Test individual components or screens** to isolate where the problem occurs.
* **Inspect the app's logic** - check if screens and buttons are connected and functioning as intended.
* **Use visuals** like screenshots to clarify and communicate what's broken or unexpected.

Editing the code directly allows you to address subtle bugs and fine-tune your app's behavior when automated fixes aren't enough.

You can edit code by clicking on 'Edit code' button on the properties panel.

Every builder, AI-assisted or not, runs into issues. What matters is moving through them quickly and confidently. With features like **Attempt Fix **and smart prompting, **Tile.dev** helps you recover fast and stay productive.
