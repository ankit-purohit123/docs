"I know what I want, I just don't know how to build it." If that sounds familiar, you're in the right place.

## Who This Guide Is For

You've got an app idea in your head. Maybe you've sketched it, explored some tools, opened a few projects… But you're stuck somewhere between *inspiration* and *execution*.

This guide is your blueprint to:
* Turn your idea into a working app
* Avoid common roadblocks
* Use **Tile.dev** effectively (even if you don't write code)

## The #1 Mistake: Jumping In Without a Plan

Many users dive into Tile.dev and try to build everything at once.

What usually happens?
* The AI gets confused
* Bugs pile up
* The project becomes unmanageable

Start with a plan. It actually helps you move faster, with fewer errors, and much better results.

## How to Go From Idea to App (The Smart Way)

### 1. Think Before You Build

Before opening Tile.dev:
* Record a voice note describing your idea
* Drop it into ChatGPT or Claude and ask: "Turn this into a basic product description"
* Ask AI to act as a **designer**, **PM**, or **developer** to help outline a simple PRD

Once your vision is clear, **then** begin building.

### 2. Write It Down

Take 10–15 minutes to jot down:
* What your app does
* Who it's for (even if it's just you)
* What a simple, usable version looks like

Turn that into a list of features or user actions. Use it in Chat Mode or with GPT to shape your plan.

### 3. Choose Your Build Flow

Tile.dev supports two main build styles:

**Front-End First (Recommended)**
* Start with mock data
* Focus on layout, flows, and UI
* Plug in Supabase when the app feels right

**Back-to-Front (For Advanced Users)**
* Start with Supabase and build both backend and frontend together
* Great for users confident with debugging and logic-heavy tasks

Not sure which to choose? Start **Front-End First**—it's easier to iterate.

### 4. Build with "Bricks"

Break your app into small, buildable chunks—or "bricks":
* One feature or flow at a time
* Test and polish it
* Then move to the next

Think: login flow → dashboard → add item → edit item → etc.

### 5. Prompt with Precision

Before typing, ask yourself:
"What do I want to build *right now*?"

Keep prompts focused. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one. Clear, step-by-step prompts = better AI output.

### 6. Use "Attempt Fix" When Stuck

If something breaks, use the **Attempt Fix** button:
* It grabs the latest error from your app screen
* Auto-pastes it into the prompt field
* Prepares a clean, debug-friendly prompt

All you need to do is review and send. Let the agent do the heavy lifting.

Bonus: Tile.dev also reads console logs—no need to copy them manually.

## Builder's Checklist

* Write your idea in 5–10 bullet points
* Identify your MVP features
* Choose a build flow: Front-End First or Back-to-Front
* Build feature-by-feature, like stacking bricks
* Connect Supabase only when you're ready
* Use **Attempt Fix** when debugging
* Share your app early and gather feedback

## Final Tip: You Are the First User

Build for yourself. Test like a real user. Think like a product owner—not just a builder.

You don't need to code to build something great. You just need a clear idea, a plan, and the right tools.

**Tile.dev** is here to help you bring it to life.
