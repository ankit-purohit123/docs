# 🎨 Visual Edits in Tile.dev

Tile’s **Visual Edits** feature lets you interact directly with your app’s preview.  
You can hover, select, and edit Tiles or components to quickly update:

- Text
- Colors
- Layout
- Behavior

✅ All without writing a single line of code or crafting a prompt.

## 🕒 When to Use Visual Edits

Use Visual Edits for:

- Updating static text on your screen  
- Changing fonts, font sizes, or styles  
- Modifying colors of text, buttons, or other UI elements

> 💡 Tip: Visual edits are best for **quick visual tweaks** that don't require structural changes or logic updates.

## 🛠️ How Visual Edits Work

1. **Hover over the app preview panel**  
2. **Click to select a Tile or component**  
3. The **Properties Panel** (on the right) will show editable properties  
4. These properties are **auto-exposed by the agent**  
5. Can’t see what you want to edit?  
   - Ask the agent to **expose** that property  
   - Or point to the element and request: “Expose this in the Properties Panel”

## 💾 Saving and Publishing Changes

- Click **Save** to store your changes in the web editor  
- If your app is already live, also click **Publish** for the updates to go live

> 🔁 Save is for editing  
> 🚀 Publish is for pushing changes to production

## 🖼️ Editing AI-Generated Image Banners

If your app includes AI-generated banners or images, you can replace or edit them using the Properties Panel.

### To Edit an Image:

1. **Click the image banner** in the preview panel  
2. If the **image property is exposed**, you can upload or change the image  
3. If not, ask the agent to **“Expose the image property”** for that element

> 🧠 This makes it easy to tailor generated visuals to match your app or brand identity.
