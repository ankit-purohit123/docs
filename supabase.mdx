# Supabase Integration in Tile.dev

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a hosted PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities, user authentication, and serverless functions. When you connect Supabase to your Tile.dev app, you instantly gain a scalable, production-ready backend without writing boilerplate code or configuring servers.

Best of all, our dedicated **Supabase Agent** seamlessly handles the integration between your backend and your Tile.dev app.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features Unlocked by Supabase Integration

- **Database (PostgreSQL):** Store and query your app data using full SQL. Tile.dev can automatically generate schema and tables from your prompts.
- **User Authentication:** Securely manage sign-ups, logins, and access control. Add pre-built flows (email/password, OAuth, etc.) with a single prompt.
- **Edge Functions (Serverless):** Run custom backend logic using JavaScript/TypeScript on Supabase infrastructure. Tile.dev will generate and deploy these functions as needed.
