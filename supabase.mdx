Tile.dev's native Supabase integration allows you to manage both your front-end UI and your back-end database through a single, prompt-driven interface. Build full-stack apps efficiently without ever leaving Tile.dev.

## Overview

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a hosted PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities, user authentication and serverless functions. When you connect Supabase to your Tile.dev app, you instantly gain a scalable, production-ready backend without writing boilerplate code or configuring servers.

## Managing Data

Use prompts to define data structures and UI in one step.

### Example Workflow

```
Add a feedback form with message and rating, and store in database.
```

Tile.dev will:
1. Create the form UI
2. Suggest SQL to create a feedback table
3. Ask you to run the SQL in Supabase
4. After confirmation, bind the form to the new table

### CRUD Operations

Try these example prompts:

<CodeGroup>
```text Create
Create a blog post form with title and content
```

```text Read
Display a list of all posts from the database
```

```text Update & Delete
Allow users to edit and delete their posts
```
</CodeGroup>

Tile.dev handles UI generation, SQL schema creation, connecting UI to Supabase tables, and auth-based filtering automatically.
