## 1. Best Practices for Prompting
### How to Write Effective Prompts to Build Apps on Tile.dev
A good prompt is like giving clear directions to a teammate—specific, focused, and easy to follow. The more precise your input, the better the app Tile.dev will generate for you.

## Start with One Clear Objective

**Less Effective:**
"Build an e-commerce app with login, admin dashboard, product management, payments, reviews, coupons, and delivery tracking."

**Better:**
"Start with an e-commerce homepage and product list. Add a login screen for users."

**Tackle one part at a time.** You can always build on top of it.

## Use Clear, Structured Language

Avoid long paragraphs. Instead, break your ideas into bullet points or short steps.

**Example:**
"I'm building a task manager app.
* Users can sign up and log in
* They can create, edit, and delete tasks
* Tasks can be marked as complete
* Tasks should be shown in a list"

This makes it easier for the AI to understand what you're trying to build.

## 2.Prompt Length Guidelines

### Why This Matters

Our AI agent is designed to help you generate apps quickly and efficiently using natural language prompts. However, **very large or overly detailed prompts** can sometimes cause issues with the system's performance, leading to failed generations or unresponsive behavior.

### Common Symptoms

* The agent fails to respond
* App generation stalls or crashes
* Error messages such as "agent not working" or "internal processing issue"

### Best Practices

* **Keep prompts concise**: Focus on the core idea of your app. Example: "Build a to-do app with login, task creation, and reminders."
* **Break down complex ideas**: If your app idea is large, split it into smaller parts and build incrementally. Examples:
* Start with "Create a login page with email/password," → Then "Add a dashboard to show tasks"
   * Use structured bullets or numbered points for clarity, instead of long paragraphs.

**What to Avoid**
* Very long descriptions with multiple features, flows, and edge cases in one go.
* Pasting documentation or multi-page requirements in a single prompt.
* Asking for multiple full app variations in one prompt.

## 3. Be Specific with Your Requests

Avoid vague terms like
"Make it look nice" or "Add some features"

Use clear directions like
"Add a search bar at the top" "Use cards to display each task with a title and due date" "Use a light theme and rounded buttons for styling"

**Example of a Good Prompt**
"Build an e-commerce app homepage with a product list and search bar."

**Example of a Problematic Prompt**
"Build a fully functional e-commerce app with user authentication, admin panel, product CRUD, payment integration, multi-language support, coupon system, and mobile responsiveness across all pages. Also include a CMS for blog content."
