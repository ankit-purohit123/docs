# 🧠 Best Practices for Prompting

A good prompt is like giving clear directions to a teammate—**specific**, **focused**, and **easy to follow**.  
The more precise your input, the better the app Tile.dev will generate.

---

## 🎯 Start with One Clear Objective

### ❌ Less Effective:

> “Build an e-commerce app with login, admin dashboard, product management, payments, reviews, coupons, and delivery tracking.”

### ✅ Better:

> “Start with an e-commerce homepage and product list. Add a login screen for users.”

🧩 Tackle **one part at a time**. You can always build on top of it.

## ✍️ Use Clear, Structured Language

Avoid long paragraphs. Instead, break ideas into bullet points or simple steps.

### Example:

> “I’m building a task manager app.
>
> - Users can sign up and log in  
> - They can create, edit, and delete tasks  
> - Tasks can be marked as complete  
> - Tasks should be shown in a list”

✅ This makes it easier for the AI to follow and generate accurately.

# 📏 Prompt Length Guidelines

## 🧐 Why This Matters

Our AI agent is optimized for **quick, natural-language app creation**.  
But overly long or complex prompts can lead to performance issues:

### 🚨 Common Symptoms:

- The agent fails to respond  
- App generation stalls or crashes  
- Error messages like: “Agent not working” or “Internal processing issue”

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Keep prompts concise**: Focus on your core idea.

```prompt
"Build a to-do app with login, task creation, and reminders."
